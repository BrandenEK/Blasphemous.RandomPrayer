## Penitence Details

- A new penance can be selected from the statue in the Brotherhood, called the 'Penitence of the Misheard Words'
- With this penance active, prayers can no longer be equipped or unequipped.  Instead, a random prayer will be used each time you attempt to use one
- The fervour cost of using a prayer is the same for all of them, since you never know which one you will use

## Configuration Settings
- These settings can be modified in the 'Random Prayer.cfg' file located in the "Modding/config" folder

| Setting | Description | Default |
| ------- | ----------- | :-----: |
| OnlyShuffleOwnedPrayers | Whether to only use prayers that you own, or all prayers in the game | false |
| RemoveMirabras | Should 'Mirabras of the Return to Port' be removed from possible prayers to use | true |
