## Penitence Details

- A new penance can be selected from the statue in the Brotherhood, called the 'Penitence of the Misheard Words'
- With this penance active, prayers can no longer be equipped or unequipped.  Instead, a random prayer will be used each time you attempt to use one
- The fervour cost of using a prayer is the same for all of them, since you never know which one you will use
